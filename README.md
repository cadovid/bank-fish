# Summary

Using Java to model a 2D simulation of a fish bank behaviour environment.

This implementation simulates the predator-prey relationship like a multi-agent autonomous system content in a developed environment for this purpose (Ocean).
We will see a set of fish, represented in the form of traits, move in a virtual ocean and avoid dangerous areas inside it (this can represent physical obstacles or areas with predators).The behaviour of the bank will therefore only be obtained by emergence.
